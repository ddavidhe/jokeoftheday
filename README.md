# jokeoftheday

Display a unique coding-related joke/pun each day!

A Chrome extension created using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Uses the JokeAPI.

From this project I learned:

- Fetch API data with JSON, and display accordingly
- Utilize Promises, with Async and Await function calls
- To use the manifest.json file to create chrome extensions
- Store values in local storage to ensure a unique joke appears each day


TODO items: 
- ~~add a date of the joke~~
- ~~add dark mode~~
- ~~ensure that the same joke of the day does not occur yesterday and today~~
- ~~link to github~~
- ~~publish extension publicly~~ (learned it costs money)
